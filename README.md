Attendance Made Easy

For me, at least

Based on Beta Theta Pi attendance protocols, but hopefully general enough for all attendance needs

### To-do list
####### Features
1. Add user-defined ordering
2. Create actual attendance taking ability (seperate app? not django?)
3. Create seperate attendee creation app
4. Attendence record screen
 * Mark rolls as mandatory, attend-x-out-of-total, or not mandatory
  * attend-x-out-of-total: create "groups" of events in which a member must attend a set number of out of total, but not any specific one
5. Create home screen with all events/rolls - maybe some metrics

####### Refactors
1. Replace the table with divs
